The Chinmaya Mission is a Hindu religious and spiritual organization engaged in the dissemination of Vedanta,
the science of the self as expounded in the Vedas, particularly the Upanishads, and other Hindu scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita.

The Chinmaya Mission was established in India in 1953 by devotees of the renowned Vedanta teacher Swami Chinmayananda Saraswati
from present-day Kerala, India.

Administered by the Central Chinmaya Mission Trust in Mumbai, India, the mission was later headed by Swami Tejomayananda
and is now headed by Swami Swaroopananda. There are over 313 mission centres all over India and abroad.
North America had more than 30 centres. It is currently administered by Central Chinmaya Mission Trust (CCMT) in
Mumbai, India, headed by Swami Swaroopananda.

The motto of Chinmaya Mission is "to give maximum happiness to maximum people for maximum time." It does not seek to convert
other religious practitioners.
